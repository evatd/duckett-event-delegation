*Scenario:* We have a shopping list. Each list item contains a link.
When the user clicks on that link, to indicate they have completed that task, the item will be removed from the list.

*Extra:* Write the code in a way it will work with IE5-8. Thus, test whether the browser supports the latest techniques (or whether it needs to fallback to use older techniques).
